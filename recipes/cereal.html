    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Literally a bowl of cereal. Why are you even here?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A bowl</li>
        <li>A spoon</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Cereal</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First go to the store and purchase a cereal box of your choice and milk</li>
        <li>Next, go home and set a bowl on a table</li>
        <li>IMPORTANT: Place the cereal in the bowl first</li>
        <li>Now we add the milk.
            <ul><li>If you prefer to eat like you're in the Sahara desert, don't add much if any milk</li>
            <li>If you prefer to eat like you're sinking on the Titanic, pour milk to the brim of the bowl</li>
            <li>If you prefer to eat like a sane person, put in an average amount of milk</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Now put the spoon in the bowl, pick up the cereal and put it in your mouth</li>
        <li>Chew the cereal with your teeth unless you enjoy choking</li>
        <li>You've done it! You've eaten a bowl of cereal. Your parents now owe me $20 for basic parenting lessons.</li>    
    </ol>
